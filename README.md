# Hello-World
My first repository
I'm thirty years old. 
I have a master degree in computer science.
But I have no real programming projects expericence.
I have forgot nearly everything of my major.
My career is a total failure, and I feel grey most of my days.
Now my job is dull and boring.
All I have to do is "sit".
I hope I could live a different life.
